# Welcome To My SWAPI Project

### Description
This project is to showcase API calls to the Star Wars API (SWAPI).
The goal was to make a simple, static application. My idea was
to use the information from the API to create a visual
representation (in a table) of the type of information
received in a successful GET API call from the SWAPI.

# Welcome To My SWAPI Project

### Description
This project is to showcase API calls to the Star Wars API (SWAPI).
The goal was to make a simple, static application. My idea was
to use the information from the API to create a visual
representation (in a table) of the type of information
received in a successful GET API call from the SWAPI. 

### How to Run My App
1. Click [here](http://replit.com/@Bambi115/StarWarsAPI). Alternatively, go to the **About** section of my project main page on Github and select the blue link _http://replit.com/@Bambi115/StarWarsAPI_
2. Once you are on repl.it, select the option that says _Fork & Run_
    - You will be prompted to sign-in (if not already) or sign up. Follow the instructions to        do so as this is the easiest way to run my project.
3. It will ask you to name the forked project which you may choose to do so if desired. Otherwise, continue with the fork.
4. The project should run automatically but just in case, there is a large green button at the top of the page that says _Run_.
5. Once the project has ran, a tab should appear to the right called _Webview_. This is the result of my project but in a smaller view.
6. To see a larger, full view, look for the green text in the url bar of the _Webview_ tab.
7. Click on this green text and it will open up more information such as _Listening on ports:_ and a _Dev URL_. Select the green dev url and it will open up a new tab showing my app on a dedicated, full webpage.
8. From there, navigate by using the navbar or selecting the images on the Homescreen.

_Notes:_ there are a coupe of known bugs and provisos. Every consecutive API call will return back slower and slower by 500ms as per the design of SWAPI.dev. Another bug is that the rightmost end of the tables seems to be missing its border in some cases. I do not know why at the moment but no information has been cut off.

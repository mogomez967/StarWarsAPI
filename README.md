# Welcome To My SWAPI Project

### Description
This project is to showcase API calls to the Star Wars API (SWAPI).
The goal was to make a simple, static application. My idea was
to use the information from the API to create a visual
representation (in a table) of the type of information
received in a successful GET API call from the SWAPI. 

### How to Run My App
1. Click [here](http://replit.com/@Bambi115/StarWarsAPI). Alternatively, go to the **About** section of my project main page on Github and select the blue link _http://replit.com/@Bambi115/StarWarsAPI_
2. Once you are on repl.it, select the option that says _Fork & Run_
    - You will be prompted to sign-in (if not already) or sign up. Follow the instructions to        do so as this is the easiest way to run my project.
3. It will ask you to name the forked project which you may choose to do so if desired. Otherwise, continue with the fork.
